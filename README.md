# Danny-Ma-8-Week-SQL-Challenge
This repository contains the answers to case study 1 in https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/

**Server used:**

MySQL Workbench

**Business Task**

In this case study, Danny wants to use his restaurant's data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.
Danny has provided me with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

sales

menu

members
